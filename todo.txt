TODO:
	- Clean up
		- Store true model functions better
		- Clean up code with variable selection and error, make more general
		- What is really necessary from the distribution list widget?
	- Improvements
		- Make true model fitting customimzable
		- Make GUI resize the right components
		- Don't let two variables be named the same thing
		- Allow different parametric distributions of data
		- Live update graph?
		- Possibly print computation as it works - progress bar?
		- Parallelization on trial
		- More options for variable selection
		- More options for residual display
		- Export to PDF

Variable selection methods:
			- Min MSE CV
			- Min prediction MSE
			- Min Bayseian Information Criteria (BIC)
			- Min Prediction CV MSE + one standard dev (tradeoff variance for bias)
			- Min MSE CV + One standard dev
			- Non-negative Garotte
			- Adaptive Lasso/LARS?
			- SCAD
			- Dantzig
			- VISA
